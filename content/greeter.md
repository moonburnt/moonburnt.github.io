Summary: *hello there*

Hello, stranger. If you are reading this - you either scrolled down really far,
or I gave up on updating this. Regardless - this is my attempt at maintaining
github pages blog, powered by pelican.

- **Why pelican?**

- Well, Because at this point of time, Im trying to become python developer.
Thus I decided that using blog engine which could be hacked by myself, with
styles powered by commonly-used in flask jinja, would be a wise choice.

- **Why github pages?**

- Because Im not feeling confident enough to pay for dedicated hosting and it
seems to be relatively easy to migrate from, in case of emergence.

- **Who even write blogs in 2k21?**

- Ikr. I just wanted to get something to start with. Maybe at some point I will
remake this into somewhat of portfolio, not sure yet. Or maybe I will give up and
this post will be the only one out there. Not sure. Time will tell.

- **Who the hell are you?**

- There is literally "about" category dedicated to this, which should be the first
thing you see, unless I've misconfigured something.
