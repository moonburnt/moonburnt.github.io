Hello, stranger and welcome to my blog. There you will find info about my projects
and some articles that may or may not come handy. Either way, lets begin with
introduction:

- **Who are you?**

- Feel free to call me moonburnt, Im netizen in early 20th. At the moment of writing
this, Im NEET who tries to learn python (and maybe, eventually, other languages) -
both to get employed and to write various things that may come handy for myself
and other people.

- **How experienced are you?**

- Thus far I've been learning python for 2.5-3 years, all by myself. I've been
doing multiple freelance works (which mostly involved either writing cli tools or
pyqt5 applications) and maintain multiple FOSS projects on github. Thus said, I
have no experience working as full-time programmer. Yet.

- **What are you interested in?**

- Linux (and opensource operation systems as a whole), utilities for daily use,
chat bots, gamedev. I've been writing [web](https://github.com/moonburnt/pymediadump)
[parsers](https://github.com/moonburnt/anidb_parser) and [cli](https://github.com/moonburnt/laymix)
[tools](https://github.com/moonburnt/romman), [discord bots](https://github.com/moonburnt/notashark)
and [various](https://github.com/moonburnt/locky) [libraries](https://github.com/moonburnt/p3dss).
At the moment, Im working on [2.5D video game](https://github.com/moonburnt/a2s3).

- **Where can I find a full list of things you've made and proud of?**

- For now, [check my github profile](https://github.com/moonburnt?tab=repositories&q=&type=source).
Eventually I will make a portfolio, I guess.

- **I've noticed some typos in your posts**

- Its because english isnt my first language. Just like with programming, I've
learned it by myself over the net. If there is anything critical - feel free to
point the issue on github.
